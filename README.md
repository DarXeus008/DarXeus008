Hi,

My name is DarXeus. I am a fellow learner of Software Development as well as Data Science. I am highly interested in machine learing and statistics. I am currently
working as an Analytical System Integrator for a company. Whilst working I am busy with several different projects as well as a course on Data Science. Currently 
I am working on a project for the entity I work for. The purpose of the project is to make my job easier and more efficient.

I am available to collaborate if help is required, I am no expert but a very fast learner with a good bit of enthusiasm.
Please feel free to contact me @ dng082376@gmail.com, however please input "Github" somewhere in the subject and I will be sure to reply ASAP.

Kind regards
A fellow IT learner
DarXeus
